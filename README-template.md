Create a README file in your repository that includes:


1. An overview of the project and the chosen Frontend Mentor challenge.
This project is from Frontend Mentor, called the Fylo Data Storage Component challenge.
The task is to make a small web page that shows how much storage is used and how much is left.

I built it using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The page works on both computer and mobile screens.
This project helped me practice making a design look the same as the example and learn more about building simple, responsive web pages.

2. A description of your approach and any customizations made.
First, I created the basic structure using HTML. Then I added Bootstrap to help with the layout and responsiveness. After that, I used some custom CSS to match the design and add my own small changes.

I changed colors, spacing, and text size to make it look better. I also tried to use CSS only where needed, keeping it simple and clean. My goal was to make the page look nice and work well on both desktop and mobile screens.

3. Any challenges faced during implementation and how they were addressed.
I faced many challenges from the start to the end of the project.
At first, it was very hard to get the images, but Tishana helped me with that. Building the left side card was easy, but the right side card took a long time. I had trouble creating the slider and the speech bubble. I also watched many videos and used some templates as a reference.

Once those parts were done, I faced another issue with the alignment between the two cards. Finally, I managed to fix everything, but in the mobile version, the cards are stacked to one side instead of being in the center.

Reflection

1. Write a brief reflection (100-200 words) discussing:Challenges you encountered during the project.
Ifaced many challenges from the start to the end of the project.
At first, it was very hard to get the images because they were in a Microsoft Edge HTML document. After that, building the left side card was easy, but the right side card took a long time. I had trouble creating the slider and the speech bubble.

Once those parts were done, I faced another issue with the alignment between the two cards. Finally, I managed to fix everything, but in the mobile version, the cards are stacked to one side instead of being in the center.


2. Your approach to solving these challenges.
I used many resources from the internet, watched videos, and used them as templates to help me with the challenges, especially the speech bubble and the slider.

3. Improvements you would make if given more time.
I will do more research to learn more about Bootstrap and fix the mobile issue. Right now, I can stack both cards one over the other, but they are not centered in the middle.If I have time after submitting, I will try to fix the mobile issue. Right now, I can stack both cards one over the other, but they are not centered in the middle.
